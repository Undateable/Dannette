I like to call myself a narrative designer (Because I am technically one)

More of me. I have knowledge in C++, C# and Python. I am, by degree, an electronic technician. But I am dabbling in Video Games.

I have a really vivid imagination so i'm currently hobbying as a game designer and story writing.
